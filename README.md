## Description

Welcome to the GitHub repository of EchoPulse, a feedback collection tool designed to revolutionize the way you gather and analyze user preferences! Built with MongoDB, React, Redux, Stripe, and Google OAuth, EchoPulse brings you a seamless and secure way to collect 'yes' or 'no' votes on a large scale.

## Features

* **Mass Emailing**: Reach out to your user base with just a few clicks. Send emails en masse and get immediate feedback.

* **Secure Authentication**: With Google OAuth, we ensure a secure and safe authentication process for all users.

* **Stripe Integration**: An upcoming feature, Stripe integration will enable secure payment and subscription services.

* **Feedback Analysis**: With a Redux and React powered front-end, EchoPulse not only collects feedback but also presents it in an intuitive, easy-to-understand format.

* **MongoDB Database**: Store your users' feedback securely and efficiently with MongoDB.

Currently, in its beta phase, EchoPulse is on a mission to streamline your decision-making process. No more wondering if your users will like a new feature or prefer one design over another. With EchoPulse, you can ask them directly, gather their responses, and make data-driven decisions. 

Join us in the journey of EchoPulse's development and watch as we refine the process of large-scale feedback collection.
